## About The Project

<p>This challenge is perfect if you're just getting started. The shift between the layouts will be a nice test if you're new to building responsive projects.
<br><br>Your users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
<br>2.See hover states for interactive elements</p>
<br>
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
